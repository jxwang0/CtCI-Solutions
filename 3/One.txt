3.1 

# 1
Array starts at arbitrary size, like 100. 
Array starts at arbitrary divisions, like 1/3rd for 1st stack, 1/3rd for second stack, 1/3rd for third stack
When 3rd of array needs more capacity, double the third (make it 66, total is 133), shift the rest

Problem (implied by hints): array doesn't use all capacity

#2 Flexible Divisions
1| --- 2|---- 3|----
1| --- 2| ---- 3|****  (needs one more)
-->
123****-------
(now add 1 to 1)
Double 1 in size, shift 2 and 3 to right
1*-23****------

# Circular Array
When you want to keep adding to 3 but it hits end of array, shift 1 and 2 rightwards if there is unused capacity and then add from beginning to end.

So...

123---------

Push: Add to bucket, shift all others rightwards 1
Pop: Take from bucket, shift all others leftwards 1

Divisions and items can overflow from right to left.

Advantages: Space efficient
Disadvantages slow... Each push and Pop takes N, where N is capacity of Stack.

Not sure this is what they were looking for.
